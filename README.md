# Meta-Prompts

## A Protocol System for AI-Assisted Software Development

Meta-prompts are structured protocol documents that initialize AI-assisted development environments before task execution begins. Instead of starting with ad-hoc prompts, a meta-prompt establishes workflow structure, behavioral constraints, verification discipline, and quality standards — creating a reliable, repeatable foundation for building software with AI agents.

This repository is the index and entry point for the Meta-Prompt Ecosystem.

---

## The Core Idea

LLMs are strong implementers but unreliable architects. They produce locally correct code that violates global design. The solution is explicit coordination protocols — documents that define culture, contracts, and memory for AI-assisted development.

Software engineering with AI is becoming a **protocol problem**, not a coding problem.

---

## The Ecosystem

Each meta-prompt is an independent, evolving repository covering a distinct domain of the software lifecycle. They work together as a composable system — the parent meta-prompt invokes companions as project needs arise.

## How It Works

### For a New Project

1. Start with **LLM-Native Software Engineering** — it defines the development methodology: how to write specifications, structure phases, verify builds, and track state across sessions.

2. When your project needs infrastructure, invoke **Deployment Engineering** to establish containerized environments, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code.

3. When your project needs a data layer, invoke **Database** to guide technology selection, schema design, and data management practices.

4. When your project has a user interface, invoke **UI/UX** to establish design principles, accessibility standards, and interaction patterns.

5. When your project approaches production, invoke **DevOps** to establish monitoring, alerting, incident response, and reliability practices.

6. When security is a requirement (it always is), invoke **Security Engineering** to define threat models, secure coding patterns, and vulnerability management.

7. When your project includes machine learning, invoke **MLOps** to establish reproducible training pipelines, model registry, drift monitoring, and serving infrastructure.

8. When designing APIs, invoke **API Design** to ensure consistent resource modeling, versioning, error handling, and documentation.

9. When defining test strategy, invoke **Testing Strategy** to establish the test pyramid, coverage targets, performance testing, and CI pipeline configuration.

10. When documentation is a deliverable, invoke **Documentation** to define documentation architecture, ADRs, and documentation-as-code pipelines.

11. When your project uses iterative delivery, invoke **Scrum** to establish sprint cycles, backlog management, ceremonies, velocity tracking, and Definitions of Done.

### For an AI Coding Agent

Paste the relevant meta-prompt into your agent's context before beginning work. The meta-prompt initializes the environment — establishing rules, constraints, and verification standards — so that subsequent task prompts execute within a structured, disciplined framework.

```
meta-prompt (environment initialization)
     ↓
task prompt (what to build)
     ↓
AI execution within that structured environment
```

The meta-prompt concept is platform-agnostic. It works with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Aider, or any LLM-based coding system.

## Key Concepts

### Three Control Documents

Every project governed by this methodology uses three files:

| Document | Function | Analogy |
|---|---|---|
| **AGENT.md** (Directive) | Defines agent behavior, constraints, and project culture | Runtime policy |
| **SPEC.md** (Specification) | Complete technical design — what to build | Interface contract |
| **BUILD_LOG.md** (Build Log) | Persistent memory across sessions — where we are | System state |

### Phase Protocol

Software is built in sequential phases, each following an identical protocol:

```
Phase Prompt → Build → Verify → Approve → Next Phase
```

The **verification step** between phases is the methodology's strongest innovation — it catches cross-boundary integration bugs that unit tests miss.

### Agent Development Runtime

As the methodology matures, the `.build` directory evolves from static documents into an orchestration layer — and eventually into a full runtime environment for coordinating AI agents in software development. This concept is detailed in the parent meta-prompt.

---

## Origin

This ecosystem was developed through the construction of [Project SAGE](https://github.com/pragnakar/Project_Sage) — an MCP server that gives LLMs certified mathematical optimization capabilities. The methodology was born from solving real problems: context loss between sessions, architectural drift during implementation, silent integration bugs, and the absence of institutional memory when AI coding agents start fresh.

Every element in these meta-prompts earned its place by catching a defect, preventing a regression, or saving significant rework during that build.

Each subdirectory is an independent git repository (submodule). They evolve separately but are designed to work together through cross-references and consistent structure.

## Canonical Meta-Prompt Structure

Every companion meta-prompt follows the same canonical structure:

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Thesis** | Why this domain matters |
| **When Invoked** | Trigger conditions for using the meta-prompt |
| **Scope** | What it covers and explicitly does NOT cover |
| **Principles** | Non-negotiable rules for the domain |
| **Practices** | Concrete implementation guidance |
| **Agent Instructions** | Do / Do NOT / Verify checklists for LLM agents |
| **Integration Points** | How it connects to every other meta-prompt |
| **Anti-Patterns** | Common mistakes and why they are harmful |
| **Quick-Start Checklist** | Actionable setup checklist |

This consistency means an LLM agent that understands one meta-prompt can navigate all of them.

---

## Getting Started

**If you're building a new project with AI coding agents:**

1. Read [LLM-Native Software Engineering](https://github.com/pragnakar/LLM_NATIVE_SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING) first
2. Set up your project with the Three Control Documents (AGENT.md, SPEC.md, BUILD_LOG.md)
3. Write phase prompts and verification prompts before you start coding
4. Invoke companion meta-prompts as your project's needs expand

**If you're exploring the methodology:**

Start with the parent meta-prompt. It contains the complete methodology, the evidence from the SAGE build, the evolution path toward agentic development, and references to all companion meta-prompts.

---

## Contributing

Each meta-prompt repository accepts contributions independently. If you've applied this methodology to a project and discovered improvements, gaps, or new patterns, contributions are welcome.

Areas of particular interest:

- Real-world case studies beyond the SAGE build
- Adaptations for specific tech stacks or domains
- Automation tooling for the .build system
- New companion meta-prompts for uncovered domains
- Integration patterns with CI/CD systems and planning tools
